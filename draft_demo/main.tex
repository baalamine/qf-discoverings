\begin{abstract}
Web search engines or open information extraction systems usually reply to
users' queries with a set of candidate answers that are often conflicting 
because they are claimed by multiple information sources. In this context, estimating information veracity is difficult for the users  especially when they have no prior knowledge about the trustworthiness of the sources. In this demo, we showcase a system that supports event/entity and relation extraction based on keyword-search from the Web, processes the conflicting outputs, combines multiple truth finding algorithms with active learning to provide the most likely true answers and determine the most trustworthy sources. 
%Our system is built on top of AllegatorTrack which is a framework that implements a set of well-established truth finding techniques. Our system has also the ability to account for users' feedbacks, based on its knowledge of the correct instances for some searched relations, in order to improve the truth finding process.
