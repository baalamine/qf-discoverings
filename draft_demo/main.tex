\begin{abstract}
Open Web Information extraction systems like TextRunner~\cite{Yates07}
or popular Web search engines such as Google or Bind usually reply to
users' search queries by returning a set of potential relevant answers. Given
some specific type of queries, the returned list might contain conflicting answers
which make thing harder for the end-users to distinguish between the truth and 
the false.
We demonstrate in the paper a system that processes answers outputted 
by open Web information extraction systems like TextRunner and provides 
the most probable answer using truth finding. Our system has also the 
capability to account for users' feedbacks, based on its knowledge of the 
correct instances for some searched relations, in order to improve the truth
finding process.
