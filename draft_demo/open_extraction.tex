In this study, we are interested on truth discovering on the large number of ``factoid" statements
(or claims) made by multiple Web sources in the same real-world domain. A ``factoid" claim is
a piece of unverified or inaccurate information that is presented as factual, often
as part of a publicity effort. Such type of claims  is usually accepted as true  because of its
frequent redundancy over multiple sources. We focus on conflicting factoid claims provided by typical 
open Web information extraction systems as answers to users' queries. Concretly, given user input, 
we retrieve the set of candidates claims, together with the associated sources, returned by TextRunner~\footnote{TextRunner is an online
at \href{http://openie.allenai.org/}{http://openie.allenai.org/}}
from a Web corpus. We then format this output in such a way that fits our truth discovering process.



% OIE Input and Ouput
\paragraph*{TextRunner System}
TextRunner system relies on an unsupervised extraction procedure which queries, using a single and data-driven 
pass, an entire Web corpus of unstructured texts and extracts a list of candidate relational tuples which might
satisfy a given user input query. Such a user input query consists typically of a sentence formed by two real-world
\emph{entities} and a certain \emph{relation}. Its semantics being that the user is looking for a set of 
claims on the Web that support or not the relation specified between the two entities. Formally, a user query
$\query$ in TextRunner can be defined as a triplet $(\e{1}, \rel{}, \e{2})$ where $\e{1}$, $\e{2}$ represent
are real-world entities and $\rel{}$ is a relation; $\rel{}$ specifies a possible relationship between the
two given entities. If any of the components of the query is empty, we say that the query is \emph{incomplete}.
Note that the extactor accepts \emph{incomplete} queries as they represent most common queries in real scenarios.
Indeed, incomplete queries, in particular those in which the second is unspecified, happen in practice in the sense 
that users are often looking for claims about unknow facts.

TextRunner outputs a list of candidate claims, ranked with respect to their supported
number of sources. The extractor also provides a pointer towards the different sources for each outputted claim in so
that it is possible to retrieve the set of sources. Given this input, the extractor searches into a corpus, consisting
of several thousand of sentences, the collections of relational tuples that might satisfy the searched relation. In other
terms, the extractor outputs a set of tuples $<(e_i, r_{i,j}, e_j)>$.

\paragraph*{Formatting of Data Sources}
We use TextRunner for the extraction of the set of 
candidates claims that might correspond to the user query.
