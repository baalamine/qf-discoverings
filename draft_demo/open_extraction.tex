 \item décrire comment on transforme l'output de OpenIE
 \item donner qq exemples

In this study, we are interested on truth discovering on the large number of ``factoid" statements
(or claims) made by multiple Web sources in the same real-world domain. A ``factoid" claim is
a piece of unverified or inaccurate information that is presented as factual, often
as part of a publicity effort. Such type of claims  is usually accepted as true  because of its
frequent redundancy over multiple sources. We focus on conflicting factoid claims provided by typical 
open Web information extraction systems as answers to users' queries. Concretly, given user input, 
we retrieve the set of candidates claims, together with the associated sources, returned by TextRunner~\footnote{TextRunner is an online
at \href{http://openie.allenai.org/}{http://openie.allenai.org/}}
from a Web corpus. We then format this output in such a way that fits our truth discovering process.



% OIE Input and Ouput
\paragraph*{TextRunner extractor}
The extraction engine relies on an unsupervised extraction procedure which queries, using a single and data-driven 
pass, an entire Web corpus of unstructured texts and extracts a list of candidate relational tuples which might
satisfy a given user input query. A user query, in this setting, consists typically of a sentence formed by three
components: two real-world \emph{entities} and a certain \emph{relation}. The goal of TextRunner being to find and
gather the set of possible claims on the Web which support or not the specified relation between the two entities. 
A user query $\query$ can be defined formally with the help of a triplet $(\e{1}, \rel{}, \e{2})$ where $\e{1}$ and $\e{2}$ 
are real-world entities and $\rel{}$ is a relation; $\rel{}$ indicates a possible relationship between the
two given entities. If some components, i.e., the second entity, of the query are not provided by the user, we 
say that the query is \emph{incomplete}. Incomplete queries are common in Web search as human often has a partial
knowledge of the real world: this motivates us the use of information extractors in order to complete his knowledge.
Note that the information extraction systems do also well in the case of \emph{incomplete} queries.

TextRunner outputs a list of candidate claims, ranked according to the number of sources. The extractor also provides a pointer
for accessing the different sources of each outputted claim in so that it is possible to retrieve the set of sources. Let denote
by $\claim{1}\ldots \claim{n}$ the set of $n$ conflicting claims extracted by TextRunner about a user query $\query$.

\paragraph*{Formatting of Data Sources}
We use TextRunner for the extraction of the set of 
candidates claims that might correspond to the user query.
