\section{Open Information Extraction}
-  décrire le type d'information auquel on s'intéresse par exemple "factoid claim"
- decrire le systeme sur lequel on se base
- décrire comment on transforme l'output de OpenIE
- donner qq exemples

We rely in this study on open information Web extractors in order to candidates tuples 
related to ``factoid claims" about real-world topics from multiple conflicting Web sources.
Open information extractors are unsupervised extraction system that makes a single, data-driven
pass over an entire corpus (unstructured texts) and extract a large set of relational tuples without 
any human intervention.

The input $t$ of the extraction system is a triplet $(e_i, r_{i,j}, e_j)$ where $e_i$ and $e_j$ are called
\emph{entities} and $r_{i,j}$ is a \emph{relation}. The semantics of $r_{i,j}$ is that that of a certain 
relationship between the two given entities. Given this input, the extractor searches into a corpus, consisting
of several thousand of sentences, the collections of relational tuples that might satisfy the searched relation.
In other terms, the extractor outputs a set of tuples $<(e_i, r_{i,j}, e_j)>$.

\paragraph*{Factoid claims} a piece of unverified or inaccurate information that is
presented in the present as factual, often as part of a publicity effort, and that is 
then accepted as true because of frequent repetition.
\paragraph*{Extraction of claims}We use TextRunner for the extraction of the set of 
candidates claims that might correspond to the user query.
