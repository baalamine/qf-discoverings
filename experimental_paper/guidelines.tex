% Guidelines and Discussions
\section{Guidelines and Discussions}
Propose guidelines in terms of what algorithm to use in what contexts with respect to 
the results of the experimental study. Then, discuss about potential improvements of 
compared algorithms and maybe a more efficient way to perform truth finding.
