The truth must be tell when reconciling such a conflicting data from different sources. This has lead to much effort of the database community and well founded truth discovering algorithms. However, there is a lack of a comparative study of both the scalability and the robustness of these algorithms. The existing comparative studies only focus on accuracy aspects. We describe, reimplement, and compare the most prominent solutions, so far, for the truth finding problems. To tackle this lack, we propose in this paper an experimental study of the robustnessand the scalability of the most referenced truth finding algorithms.  Our outline is as follows.First, we overview the truth finding problem by giving preliminary definitions and propose a classificartion of the literaturein truth finding. Then, we restrict to the twelve more referenced truth finding algorithm, by detailing each of them. We finallyproceed to the experimental study of the robustness and the scalability of the twelve algorithms.\end{abstract}% Introduction\section{Introduction}\input{overview}\input{twelve_algo}\input{experimental}% conclusion\section{Conclusion}\end{document}
