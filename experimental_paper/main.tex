The truth must be tell when reconciling such a conflicting data from different sources. This has lead to much effort of the database community and well founded truth discovering algorithms. However, there is a lack of a comparative study of both the scalability and the robustness of these algorithms. The existing comparative studies only focus on accuracy aspects. We describe, reimplement, and compare the most prominent solutions, so far, for the truth finding problems. To tackle this lack, we propose in this paper an experimental study of the robustnessand the scalability of the most referenced truth finding algorithms.  Our outline is as follows.First, we overview the truth finding problem by giving preliminary definitions, a classificartion of the literature, andby describe in details the algorithms (most referenced algorithms) we have considered in this study.\end{abstract}\section{Introduction}\section{Overview on Truth Finding Algorithms}\subsection{Preliminaries}\subsection{Classification}Cluster the algorithms in the three following classes.\begin{itemize} \item Iterative algorithms: \item EM based algorithms: \item Dependency detection based algorithms:\end{itemize}\subsection{Twelve Truth Finding Algorithms}We details in the sections, the truth finding algorithms we have considered for the comparative study.Some points to put in this section.\begin{itemize} \item Details each technique by giving its pseudo-code \item Hierarchical graph based representation of the common characteristics of the different algorithms \item \end{itemize}\section{Experimental Study}\subsection{Parameter Setting Evaluation}Evaluation of the parameter initialization of each algorithm on Book dataset.Validation of parameter setting inferred from experiments on the Bookdataset by using other datasets, e.g., Flight dataset. (Maybe this point shouldbe moved to the experimental secion).\subsection{Scalability}We compare here the different algorithms in terms of scalability, i.e., does eachof them scale when the size of the input dataset increases exponentially.\subsection{Guidelines and Discussions}Propose guidelines in terms of what algorithm to use in what contexts with respect to the results of the experimental study. Then, discuss about potential improvements of compared algorithms and maybe a more efficient way to perform truth finding.\section{Conclusion}
