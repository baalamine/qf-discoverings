% Twelve algorithms to compare
\section{Twelve Truth Finding Algorithms}


We details in the sections, the truth finding 
algorithms we have considered for the comparative study.
Some points to put in this section.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Details each technique by giving its pseudo-code
 \item Hierarchical graph based representation of the common characteristics of the different algorithms
\end{itemize}
