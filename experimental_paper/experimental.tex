\section{Experimental Study}

\subsection{Parameter Setting Evaluation}
Evaluation of the parameter initialization of each algorithm on Book dataset.
Validation of parameter setting inferred from experiments on the Book
dataset by using other datasets, e.g., Flight dataset. 

\subsection{Scalability Evaluation}
We compare here the different algorithms in terms of scalability, i.e., does each
of them scale when the size of the input dataset increases exponentially.

\subsection{Guidelines and Discussions}
Propose guidelines in terms of what algorithm to use in what contexts with respect to 
the results of the experimental study. Then, discuss about potential improvements of 
compared algorithms and maybe a more efficient way to perform truth finding.
