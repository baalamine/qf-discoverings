\section{Experimental Study}

\subsection{Robustness evaluation}
In this section, we evaluate and compare the robutness of the algorithms
in terms of the variation of their accuracy with respect to parameter initialization
and the characteristics of used datasets.

\subsubsection{Parameter Initialization}
Evaluation of the robutness of the parameters of each algorithm on Book dataset.
Validation of parameter setting inferred from experiments on the Book
dataset by using other datasets, e.g., Flight dataset. 

\subsubsection{Dataset Characteristics}
Evaluation of the robutness of each algorithm with respect to the type of dataset.

% Scalability evaluation
\subsection{Scalability evaluation}
We evaluate and compare here the scalability of the algorithms, i.e., their
running time when the amount of data increases exponentially.
