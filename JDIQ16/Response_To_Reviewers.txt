Dear Editor,

We thank the editor and the reviewers for their constructive comments, which helped us to improve the manuscript. 
Below, we address all comments point-by-point within the 3-pages limit for challenge papers, discussing the subsequent 
modifications we made on the new version of our submission. 


On behalf of all co-authors,

Reviewer #1
- Within the 3-pages limit, we better explained actual challenges in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 respectively.
- The limitations of current truth discovery methods have been explicitly mentioned in the third paragraph.
- Suggested changes to the bibliographic citations have been incorporated, i.e., reference entries are numbered now.
- A more detailled description of DAFNA project was not included although it was suggested by Reviewer #1 
mainly due to space limitation. However, we have pointed to the DAFNA project's Website for more details.

- The limitations of current truth discovery methods have been explicitly mentioned in the third paragraph.
